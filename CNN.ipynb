        "\n",
        "A CNN is a type of artificial neural network designed to process and analyze visual data, like images. It is inspired by the way the human brain processes visual information in the visual cortex.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the human brain, neurons in the visual cortex are specialized to detect specific patterns, such as edges, shapes, or textures. Similarly, a CNN identifies features in images through layers of connected neurons, progressively learning more complex features.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Steps in a CNN:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Image:**\n",
        "   - For example, we have a grayscale image of size $6 \\times 6$, where each pixel intensity value ranges from 0 to 255.\n",
        "   - To normalize the pixel values, we scale them to a range of 0 to 1 using min-max scaling:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   \\text{Normalized Value} = \\frac{\\text{Pixel Value}}{255}.\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Convolution Operation:**\n",
        "   - A **filter (or kernel)** is a small matrix (e.g., $3 \\times 3$) that slides over the image and performs element-wise multiplication followed by summation. This operation helps detect features like edges.\n",
        "   - If the input image is $n \\times n$ (e.g., $6 \\times 6$) and the filter is $f \\times f$ (e.g., $3 \\times 3$), the output size is determined by the formula:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   \\text{Output Size} = (n - f + 1) \\times (n - f + 1).\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For a $6 \\times 6$ input and a $3 \\times 3$ filter, the output size becomes $4 \\times 4$.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Padding:**\n",
        "   - Padding involves adding a border (of zeros or other values) around the input image to control the size of the output.\n",
        "   - Without padding, the image shrinks after each convolution. Padding prevents this loss of information.\n",
        "   - The formula for output size with padding is:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   \\text{Output Size} = (n + 2p - f + 1) \\times (n + 2p - f + 1),\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   where $p$ is the padding size.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For example, with $p = 1$, the $6 \\times 6$ image padded becomes $8 \\times 8$, and with a $3 \\times 3$ filter, the output size is $6 \\times 6$ (no shrinkage).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Types of Padding:**\n",
        "   - **Valid Padding:** No padding; results in smaller output.\n",
        "   - **Same Padding:** Pads the image so the output size matches the input size.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Feature Extraction:**\n",
        "   - The convolutional layer extracts features, such as edges, corners, or textures, by applying multiple filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Activation Function:**\n",
        "   - After convolution, an activation function (like ReLU) introduces non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Pooling:**\n",
